A somewhat larger data mod, it completely changes AOE2 on it's head with seamless age transitions, much larger scale, and a more "total war" sort of tactical warfare. Towers require archers to fire, archers fire slowly and in an area but deal lots of damage if they hit their target. Buildings are more expensive, a bit of rebalance was done, walls are really strong barriers but also much more costly in time and resources and rams are not completely overpowered.
